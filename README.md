## Description

A simple random password generator that I made using Javascript.

## Installation

## Usage

Click this link https://m-beke.github.io/password-generator/ to be taken to the application. 

From there, click the 'Generate Password' to begin. You will be prompted to enter the amount of characters you would like to use. The amount must be between 8-128. Then, it will ask if you would like to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, or special characters. You must choose at least one option for the password to be generated. After this, your new random password will appear in the text box on the webpage.
